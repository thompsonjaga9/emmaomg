            <h1>EMMANUEL EMMAOMG EDUNJOBI</h1>
            <p>
              Emmanuel Edunjobi, popularly known by his stage name, EmmaOMG, is
              a multi-talented entertainer whose repertoire includes comedy,
              acting, music (vocals and instrumentals) and content creation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emmanuel’s romance with entertainment started at the age of 8 when
              he joined his church choir as an instrumentalist. His dexterity
              with the guitar, piano and drums was borne out of interest as he
              is largely self taught.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite his skills in the other forms of entertainment he often
              refers to music as his first love as evidenced by his weekly
              Yoruba gospel praise medleys on Instagram and YouTube and his
              parodies of hit songs.
